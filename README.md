💊 Pharmacy Management System (Python Tkinter)
📌 Description

Pharmacy Management System is a desktop-based application developed using Python and Tkinter to automate and simplify the daily operations of a medical store. The main goal of this project is to provide an efficient billing system, manage medicine inventory, and securely store customer data in a database.

The application allows users to generate bills by entering customer details such as name, phone number, age, and selected medicines. It automatically calculates totals and creates a detailed bill showing medicine names, quantities, prices, and final amount. The generated bill can be printed, and all transaction data is saved in the database for future reference.

Each medicine includes proper information such as description, price, expiry date, and stock status, helping pharmacists easily track available items. The system also identifies out-of-stock medicines, making inventory management simple and organized.

A secure Admin Panel is included, accessible only to authorized users. Through this panel, the admin can add new medicines, update existing medicine records, manage stock levels, and view customer purchase history using a unique reference number. This helps in tracking customers and maintaining accurate sales records.

Overall, this Pharmacy Management System reduces manual work, improves accuracy, and provides a user-friendly interface for managing pharmacy operations efficiently. It is an ideal solution for small to medium medical stores looking to digitize their workflow.
