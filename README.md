🌱 Nursery Management System (Python Tkinter)
📌 Description

Nursery Management System is a desktop-based application developed using Python and Tkinter to automate and simplify the daily operations of a plant nursery. The main goal of this project is to provide an efficient billing system, manage plant inventory, and securely store customer data in a database.

The application allows users to generate bills by entering customer details such as name, phone number, age, and selected plants. It automatically calculates totals and creates a detailed bill showing plant names, quantities, prices, and final amount. The generated bill can be printed, and all transaction data is saved in the database for future reference.

Each plant includes proper information such as description, price, category, and stock status, helping nursery staff easily track available items. The system also identifies out-of-stock plants, making inventory management simple and organized.

A secure Admin Panel is included, accessible only to authorized users. Through this panel, the admin can add new plants, update existing records, manage stock levels, and view customer purchase history using a unique reference number. This helps in tracking customers and maintaining accurate sales records.

Overall, this Nursery Management System reduces manual work, improves accuracy, and provides a user-friendly interface for managing nursery operations efficiently. It is an ideal solution for small to medium nurseries looking to digitize their workflow.
